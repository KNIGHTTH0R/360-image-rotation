Rotate an image 360 with jquery

You need to upload the number of images that you need in rotating the image, i.e, if 100 images with different angles were uploaded (say 1,2,3,4...100).jpg then you can rotate the image to 100 positions.

this will get updated in the below line of code in the rotate.html file

_vr = new VR('viewer', 'small/#.jpg', 'big/#.jpg', 118, VRoptions);

where small and big are the two different folders with images 1.jpg, 2.jpg, ... 100.jpg
